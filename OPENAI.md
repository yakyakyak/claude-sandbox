This file provides guidance for working with OpenAI models in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a sandbox repository for experimenting with OpenAI models. The repository is currently empty and ready for development.

## Getting Started

This repository uses the BSD 3-Clause License and is ready for development. No specific build tools, dependencies, or commands have been configured yet.

## Verilog-Based Design Guidance

This section provides guidance for working with Verilog-based designs using OpenAI models.

### Tools and Environment

- **Verilator**: This repository uses Verilator for Verilog simulation. Ensure Verilator is installed and properly configured.
- **SVUnit**: For unit testing Verilog designs, SVUnit is utilized. Make sure SVUnit is set up in your environment.

### Workflow

1. **Model Integration**: Integrate OpenAI models to assist in the design and verification of Verilog modules.
2. **Simulation**: Use Verilator to simulate Verilog designs and verify functionality.
3. **Testing**: Employ SVUnit to create and run unit tests for Verilog modules.

### Best Practices

- Maintain clear and concise documentation for each Verilog module.
- Use version control effectively to track changes in Verilog designs and associated tests.
- Regularly update and review test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Development Notes

- Repository is under BSD 3-Clause License
- Currently no specific development environment or build system configured
- Ready for initial project setup and development
